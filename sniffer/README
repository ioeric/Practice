by Eric Liu

Based on libpcap 
Environment: Linux
To use this sniffer, please make sure you have libpcap installed in your system!!!
If you do not have libpcap:
	sudo yum install pcap
	or
	apt-get install pcap

Usage:
	gcc sniffer.c -o sniffer -lpcap
	sudo ./sniffer interface_name bridge_name (filter_file_name)
=======================================================
	cat filter
	--------------------------
	tcp and not src 123.125.114.144
	--------------------------
	
	Example:
		sudo ./sniffer wlan0 br0 filter
=======================================================

	Comment: 
	
	Sniffe all packets through interface and write them into net bridge br0.
	Syntax in filter is the same as tcpdump.
	You can use tcpdump or wireshark to check whether packets have been written to bridge or not.
