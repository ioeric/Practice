Sniffer.c V1.0.0

by Eric Liu (eric.alluse@gmail.com)
If you find any bug, please let me know :) I would appeciate itÔºÅ
Based on libpcap 
Environment: Linux

To use this sniffer, please make sure you have libpcap installed in your system!!!
If you do not have libpcap:
	sudo yum install pcap
	or
	apt-get install pcap

Usage:
	gcc sniffer.c -o sniffer -lpcap
	sudo ./sniffer interface_name bridge_name (filter_file_name)
=======================================================
	cat filter
	--------------------------
	tcp and not src 123.125.114.144
	--------------------------
	
	Example:
		sudo ./sniffer wlan0 br0 filter

	Comment: 

	Sniffe all packets through interface wlan0 and write them into net bridge br0.
	Syntax in filter is the same as tcpdump. In this filter, we only sniff TCP packet and exclude
	packets from 123.125.114.144

	You can use tcpdump or wireshark to check whether packets have been written to bridge or not.
