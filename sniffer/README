This is a basic sniffer written by Eric Liu

Based on libpcap 
Environment: Linux

Usage:
	gcc sniffer.c -o sniffer -lpcap
	sudo ./sniffer interface_name bridge_name (filter_file_name)
=======================================================
	cat filter
	--------------------------
	tcp and not src 123.125.114.144
	--------------------------
	
	Example:
		sudo ./sniffer wlan0 br0 filter
=======================================================

	Comment: 
	
	Sniffe all packets through interface and write them into net bridge br0.
	Syntax in filter is the same as tcpdump.
	You can use tcpdump or wireshark to check whether packets have been written to bridge or not.
